The challenge Fuzyll from the CSAW 2016 CTF provided a series of clues leading up to the flag. One of the clues was derived from decoding a message encoded in a funky base52 format. I had no prior knowledge of ruby prior to writing the script, but I managed to scrap out something that decoded the message. 

The decoded message is below: 

"CSAW 2016 FUZYLL RECON PART 4 OF ?: In addition to WoW raiding, I've also been playing a bunch of Smash Bros. This year, I competed in my first major tournament! I got wrecked in every event I competed in, but I still had fun being in the crowd. This tournament in particular had a number of upsets (including Ally being knocked into losers of my Smash 4 pool). On stream, after one of these big upsets in Smash 4, you can see me in the crowd with a shirt displaying my main character! The next part is at /csaw2016/<the winning player's tag>"
